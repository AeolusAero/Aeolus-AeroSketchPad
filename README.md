# Aeolus-AeroSketchPad
Aeolus ASP An aerodynamic analysis and optimization tool. It allows you to easily model
- fixed-wing aircraft configurations
- propeller blades

and to optimize model parameters (such as wing/propeller shape, or flight condition) to meet your design requirements.

Aeolus ASP allows you to test innovative ideas, see the impact of design changes in almost real-time, explore the design space, and to optimize your design concept on your computer. It applies an innovative boundary element method designed for best-in-class computational speed and fidelity, which ultimately enables efficient screening and optimization of new design concepts for aircraft or propeller blades.
